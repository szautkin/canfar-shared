# Loading States Design Document

## By: Uma (UI/UX Designer)

### Design Requirements

Based on our Material UI v7 design system, I'm creating loading state designs for:

1. **Skeleton Loading States**
   - For TextField components
   - For Select components
   - For Button components
   - For Card components
   - For Table rows

2. **Progress Indicators**
   - Linear progress for form submissions
   - Circular progress for button actions
   - Indeterminate progress for async operations

3. **Loading Overlays**
   - Full-screen loading overlay
   - Component-level loading overlay
   - Inline loading states

### Design Tokens

Using our existing design system tokens:

- Animation duration: 300ms (from transitions.duration.standard)
- Easing: easeInOut (from transitions.easing)
- Skeleton color: palette.action.hover
- Skeleton wave animation: palette.action.selected

### Component Specifications

#### TextField Skeleton

- Height: Matches TextField size (sm: 40px, md: 48px, lg: 56px)
- Width: 100% by default
- Border radius: 4px (matching theme.shape.borderRadius)
- Animation: Wave effect moving left to right

#### Select Skeleton

- Same dimensions as TextField skeleton
- Includes dropdown icon placeholder on the right

#### Button Skeleton

- Height: Matches button size
- Width: Based on typical button content (120px default)
- Border radius: 4px
- Animation: Pulse effect

### Implementation Notes for Development Team

1. Use MUI's Skeleton component as base
2. Apply our custom theme tokens
3. Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA labels
4. Consider reduced motion preferences

### Next Steps

- Create Figma mockups for each loading state
- Collaborate with Frank on accessibility requirements
- Work with CSS Specialist on animation implementations
